				<h1>What We've Built</h1>
				<p>In its first year of operation, the Seed to Table Program provided 3,000 hours of garden based, nutrition education and 2,700 pounds of nutritious foods to the Sisters community. Over the 2013/2014 school year the S2T farm saw 163 students from all three schools across the Sisters School District. This totaled over <em>3,000 hours of student involvement</em> on the farm and 100 hours of adult involvement in the program. On the farm, students and adults participate in garden based education covering nutrition, science, art, business management, the basics of growing ones’ own food, the importance of supporting local farmers and physical activity.
				From the Seed to Table Program’s farm plot, students and community members provide fresh produce to the Sisters Kiwanis Food Bank and to Sisters schools.
				The program wrote, received and manages the Oregon Department of Education’s Farm to School grant program. The program works with Oregon farmers and distributers and has brought in over 2,500 pounds of nutritious and locally grown and processed foods to the Sisters schools.
				The S2T Program conducts community presentations, so far involving over 400 hours of adult participation. Presentations examined the importance of eating nutritious and locally grown foods and how the community can help address this issue.
