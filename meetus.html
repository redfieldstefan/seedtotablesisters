				<h3>Audrey Tehan</h3>
				<h4>Program Director</h4>
				<p>Audrey Tehan was hired to direct the Seed to Table program in Sisters, OR in September 2013.  Audrey was born and raised in Sisters and comes from a family of ranchers and farmers. Growing food using practices that sustain both our natural resources and our community have always been an important aspect of Audrey's life.  After high school she worked on multiple organic farms in the US and abroad.  She graduated from Southern Oregon University with a degree in Environmental Studies, focusing on Politics and Conservation Biology. Inolving kids in education beyond the classroom has also been at the forefront of Audrey's focus as she has worked with kids and adults in experiential education for the past 5 years.  Audrey's studies and farming experiences reinforced her belief that being involved in growing food can be a pathway to living long, healthy lives and connecting with those around us.  Audrey is passionate about the Sisters community, and has had a life long aspiration to start a Seed to Table Program in Sisters.  She is excited to be serving her community in this way, and looks forward to connecting with you across a row of veggies in the garden!</p>
